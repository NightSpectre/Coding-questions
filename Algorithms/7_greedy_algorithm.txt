Greedy algorithm - It is a problem solving approach in which we make a locally-optimal solution 
                   which seems to be the best at the moment to find globally optimal solution

Ex- For minimum num,ber of coins required to male a change from the available list of coinys

36 cents {1,2,5,20,10}

giving coin with large vlue as first preference
